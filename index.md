Please find a list of resources you can use to familiarize yourself with quantum computing. 

IBM Quantum Experience is a free interactive tool that gives you access to highly advanced quantum computers. Explore this program by learning new things such as developing and learning programs. Whether you’d like to try for fun, or you want more coding practice, it’s an excellent course of action!‍

Quantum Computing Playground is a software that takes you on a roller coaster of information, visuals, and interactive works. Playing with algorithms has never been more fun!

Introducing ProjectQ, a software that allows any user to apply their quantum programs in Python. These quantum programs are then run on classic computers or quantum chips, translated by ProjectQ. ProjectQ establishes a fun and diverse way to put any quantum programs to use, while making your quantum dreams come true. How cool would it be to see your very own programs run on a quantum chip
